    \Large \textbf{Teaching Statement}

\vspace{5mm}

My main belief as a teacher is that science and computing are 
not just for experts. They are useful tools that help everyone 
to think critically and solve problems. This is very important 
in a college, where students from all backgrounds come to build 
their future. My main goal is to show students that science is 
interesting, fun, and useful in their lives.

\noindent\textbf{Teaching Methodology}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Creating a Good Classroom Environment:} I want to 
    make a classroom where all students feel comfortable to try 
    hard problems, ask questions, and learn. I have taught students 
    from many backgrounds, including students who are learning English. 
    From this, I know it is important to be patient, speak clearly, 
    and repeat important ideas. I want to make a supportive class where 
    students are not afraid to make mistakes.

    \item \textbf{Connecting Ideas to the Real World:} I try to make 
    difficult ideas easy to understand by connecting them to real life. 
    In my physics classes, I use examples from students' own lives and 
    career goals. For example, I explain conservation of energy using a 
    roller coaster, or for a nursing student, using the body's metabolism. 
    Using real examples helps students understand physics and mathematics better 
    and makes them more curious.

    \item \textbf{Using Computers and Online Tools:} As a computational 
    physicist, I think it is important to teach modern computer skills. 
    I helped develop an online physics lab, so I am good at making 
    online classes work well. I can use tools like Python, Jupyter Notebooks, 
    and other online platforms to help students learn and get the support 
    they need, in person or online.

    \item \textbf{Active Learning and Helping Students:} I believe students 
    learn by doing. I encourage students to talk in class and I give them 
    problems to solve together. My experience in the Physics Help Center 
    showed me that helping students one-on-one is very important. I see my 
    job as a guide who helps students become more confident and skillful.
\end{itemize}

I am excited to have the chance to join an academic institution that wants to provide good 
education to all students. I want to share my experience of Physics, Mathematics, 
and Programming with new students.
